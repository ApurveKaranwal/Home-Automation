# 🏠 Home Automation System

This project is a **Home Automation System** that allows you to control **4 appliances** (lights, fans, etc.) remotely using **NodeMCU**, a **4-channel relay module**, and **Blynk app buttons**.  
The Arduino Uno handles the relay switching, while the NodeMCU connects to Wi-Fi and communicates with the Blynk cloud.
